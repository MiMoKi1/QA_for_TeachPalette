Overview
This extended test plan now includes edge case testing and performance scenarios in addition to the initial functional UI testing.

Features to Test
In addition to the previously described functionality, the following tests will cover edge cases and performance scenarios:

Feature	Description
Grid Button & Slider	Edge case tests for grid visibility, incorrect slider values (out of range), and boundary testing for slider movement.
Canvas Rendering	Performance tests for uploading large images, edge cases for unsupported file types, and handling of oversized images.
Grid Background Color	Test for boundary colors, invalid inputs (like clicking outside the color wheel), and performance under different color load scenarios.
Palette Dropdown	Edge case testing for palette behavior with minimal/maximal selections, rapid selection/deselection of multiple paints.
Paint Selection/Deselection	Performance when multiple paint options are selected/deselected quickly.


Edge Case Testing
Test Case ID	Feature	Test Data	Expected Result
TC10	Grid Button	Click grid button multiple times rapidly	Grid toggles visibility with no UI crash or delay.
TC11	Grid Slider	Move slider to 0 or 12	The grid does not appear when slider is at 0; grid shows 12 columns/rows when slider is at 12.
TC12	Canvas Rendering	Upload a 10MB high-resolution image	The image uploads successfully, but the app compresses or scales it appropriately to fit within the canvas.
TC13	Grid Color Change	Click outside of the color wheel	No grid color change should occur if the user clicks outside the color wheel (invalid interaction).
TC14	Palette Dropdown	Click rapidly between multiple colors	Dropdown remains stable, and no selection or deselection anomalies occur.
TC15	Paint Selection/Deselection	Select and deselect all paints in rapid succession	All selections/deselections should work seamlessly without UI delay or glitch.


Performance Testing
Test Case ID	Feature	Test Data	Expected Result
TC16	Canvas Rendering	Upload 5-10 high-res images (over 10MB each)	The app handles multiple large image uploads without crashing, with images compressed and resized as needed.
TC17	Grid Button & Slider	Rapidly toggle grid and move the slider back and forth	The grid and slider should adjust smoothly without lag or crash.
TC18	Palette Dropdown	Open and close the dropdown 50 times quickly	The dropdown opens and closes without delay or lag, and all selected colors are correctly registered.
TC19	Paint Selection/Deselection	Select/deselect 50+ colors in quick succession	The UI should not experience any lag, and all selections/deselections should be reflected immediately.

So what does a manual tester actually. Not theory like the exact steps…look at requirement then make test plans then use tools…what tools jira for manual testing
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A manual tester's actual daily tasks are more practical and hands-on than theory. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what they do in the real world, along with the tools they use:

1. Understanding Requirements
What happens: The tester reviews documents like user stories, acceptance criteria, or technical specs to understand what needs testing.
Tools used:
JIRA (to track requirements, log bugs, and manage test cases).
Confluence (for requirement documentation and collaboration).
2. Creating Test Cases
What happens: The tester writes detailed test cases for each requirement. This includes step-by-step instructions, expected results, and edge cases.
Tools used:
Excel/Google Sheets (simple projects).
Test Management Tools like TestRail, Zephyr (JIRA plugin), or Xray.
3. Setting Up the Test Environment
What happens: Ensuring everything is ready to test—installing the app, setting up test data, and configuring systems.
Tools used:
Virtual Machines or cloud-based environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Docker).
Browser tools like Chrome DevTools for debugging.
4. Executing Tests
What happens: Following the test cases and manually interacting with the system (clicking buttons, entering data, etc.) to see if it behaves as expected. This includes:
Functional testing.
Exploratory testing (freestyle testing without formal test cases).
Tools used:
The product itself.
Browser tools (for web apps).
Screen recording tools (like Loom or OBS Studio) to document issues.
5. Logging Bugs
What happens: Any issues found during testing are documented clearly, with steps to reproduce, screenshots, and severity levels.
Tools used:
JIRA, Bugzilla, or Trello for logging bugs.
Screenshot tools like Snagit or Greenshot.
Recording tools like ShareX.
6. Regression Testing
What happens: Retesting fixed bugs and checking if new updates have broken anything else.
Tools used:
Same test management and bug tracking tools.
7. Collaboration with Developers
What happens: Frequent discussions with developers to clarify issues, retest fixes, or explain bugs.
Tools used:
Slack, Teams, or email.
Screen-sharing tools like Zoom.
8. Reporting Progress
What happens: Sharing testing updates with stakeholders via daily stand-ups or reports.
Tools used:
JIRA dashboards or custom reports.
Excel/Google Sheets (for small teams).
9. Learning and Adapting
What happens: Manual testers constantly adapt their skills, whether learning about new features, debugging tools, or testing methodologies.
Tools used:
Documentation tools (Confluence).
Online resources for self-learning.
Tools and Skills Beyond JIRA
JIRA isn’t the only tool. While it’s a staple for bug tracking and task management, manual testers also use tools for:

Test management: TestRail, Zephyr, Xray.
Exploratory testing: Session-based tools like Rapid Reporter.
API testing (yes, some manual testers do this): Postman, curl.
Documentation: Google Docs, Confluence.
Team collaboration: Slack, Teams.
Would you like a focus on a particular area, like how to write test cases or how JIRA integrates with testing?






You said:
But like manual testing can be automated so why isn’t it
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
That's a great question! While automation is powerful, there are several reasons why manual testing still exists and is essential:

1. Not Everything Can Be Automated
Human Intuition and Creativity:
Manual testers can explore beyond the scripted paths, finding bugs automation might miss. For example:
Checking aesthetic or UI/UX issues (e.g., "This color doesn’t feel right").
Testing for usability problems or odd behaviors (e.g., "This flow is confusing").
Ad-hoc and Exploratory Testing: Automation follows scripts, but manual testers can test creatively, uncovering unexpected issues.
2. Automation Takes Time and Effort to Build
Writing automated tests requires coding skills and effort, especially for complex systems.
For new or rapidly changing features, building and maintaining automation might not be worth the cost compared to quick manual testing.
Automating tests for one-time or low-risk tasks isn’t efficient.
3. Automation Can Fail at the Wrong Time
Automated tests rely on stability in the application. If the UI or APIs change frequently, automation tests can break, leading to:
False positives (tests fail but the app works fine).
False negatives (tests pass but a bug exists).
Manual testers can adapt quickly and validate if the failure is genuine or a script issue.

4. Cost and Resource Constraints
Automation tools and skilled engineers cost money. Small teams or projects with limited budgets may rely on manual testing instead.
Manual testers can onboard quickly compared to automating everything.
5. Some Types of Testing Are Hard to Automate
Exploratory Testing: Unscripted, human-driven exploration to find edge cases.
Usability Testing: Gauging how real users interact with the system.
Visual and Aesthetic Testing: Verifying that UI elements look correct across devices and browsers.
Ad-hoc Testing: Quick, informal testing without scripts.
6. Manual Testing Complements Automation
Even with automation, manual testing is needed for:
Validating automated test results.
Testing edge cases or real-world scenarios not covered in scripts.
Running tests during early development stages (when automation isn’t ready).
7. Automation Has Its Own Bugs
Automation scripts themselves can have errors. If the automation fails, manual testers validate whether the issue is in the application or the script.
When Should You Automate?
For repetitive, stable, and predictable tasks like regression testing.
When ROI is high: saving time and resources over the long term.
When Is Manual Testing Better?
For short-term or exploratory tasks.
When testing complex scenarios that are hard to script.
When validating user experience.
In practice, manual and automated testing often work together to ensure a well-rounded testing process. Automating everything isn’t always practical or cost-effective. Would you like advice on balancing both in a testing role?

You said:
Yes and would this be a typical day, like what else would the do and how would they test restful api
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, this is a typical day for a manual tester working on a web application, but there are additional tasks they might do depending on the project and tools involved. If they're also responsible for API testing, here's how their day might expand.

Additional Responsibilities on a Typical Day
Regression Testing

Retesting previously tested functionality after new features or bug fixes are implemented.
Verifying that bug fixes haven't introduced new issues (smoke testing).
Exploratory Testing

Testing the application in an unscripted, creative way to find unexpected issues.
Collaborating with Developers

Attending discussions to clarify requirements.
Reviewing log files with developers for backend or API issues.
Test Environment Setup

Preparing test data for different scenarios (e.g., creating user accounts with specific roles).
API Testing

Testing RESTful APIs (often needed if the app uses APIs for data exchange).
How to Test RESTful APIs Manually
Tools Used:
Chrome DevTools: For inspecting API calls made by the application.
Postman (or sometimes just curl or browser extensions): To send manual API requests.
Excel: To log test cases and results.
Google Docs: To document issues or test plans.
Steps for Manual API Testing
Step 1: Understand API Requirements
Goal: Review API documentation to understand the endpoints and expected behavior.

Document Reviewed:
Example: API Documentation (provided by the developer or a tool like Swagger).

makefile
Copy code
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/login  
Description: Authenticates a user and returns a token.  
Request:  
- Headers: Content-Type: application/json  
- Body: {"username": "user", "password": "pass"}  
Response:  
- 200: {"token": "xyz123"}  
- 401: {"error": "Invalid credentials"}  
Step 2: Write Test Scenarios for APIs
Goal: Create test cases covering positive, negative, and edge cases.

Document Created: Test Cases (Excel)
Example Content:

Test Case ID	API Endpoint	Method	Test Data	Expected Response	Status	Comments
API_TC01	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "user", "password": "pass"}	200 OK, token in response body.		
API_TC02	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "wrong", "password": "pass"}	401 Unauthorized, "Invalid credentials."		
API_TC03	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "", "password": ""}	400 Bad Request, validation error.		
Step 3: Execute Tests in Postman
Goal: Verify API functionality by sending requests and analyzing responses.

Steps in Postman:
Create a new collection for the API tests (e.g., "Login API Tests").
Add requests for each test case.
Example Request:
Method: POST
URL: https://example.com/api/v1/login
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"username": "user", "password": "pass"}
Send the request and check the response.
Postman Output:
Example Response:

vbnet
Copy code
Status: 200 OK  
Body: {"token": "xyz123"}  
Step 4: Log Results in Excel
Update the test case document with actual results:

Test Case ID	API Endpoint	Method	Test Data	Expected Response	Status	Comments
API_TC01	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "user", "password": "pass"}	200 OK, token in response body.	Pass	
API_TC02	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "wrong", "password": "pass"}	401 Unauthorized, "Invalid credentials."	Pass	
API_TC03	POST /api/v1/login	POST	{"username": "", "password": ""}	400 Bad Request, validation error.	Fail	No error returned.
Step 5: Debug Issues Using Chrome DevTools
Goal: Observe API calls made by the app and validate that they match expectations.

Steps in Chrome DevTools:

Open the application and navigate to the login page.
Open DevTools (Ctrl + Shift + I) and switch to the Network tab.
Perform login actions in the UI.
Check the API request/response details in the Network tab.
Example Observations:

vbnet
Copy code
Request: POST /api/v1/login  
Payload: {"username": "user", "password": "pass"}  
Response: 500 Internal Server Error  
Actions Taken:

Capture a screenshot of the error.
Report the issue in JIRA.
Step 6: Report Bugs
Goal: Log issues for failing test cases or unexpected behavior.

Bug Report in JIRA:

vbnet
Copy code
Title: Login API - Empty Fields Not Returning Validation Error.  
Description:  
Steps to Reproduce:  
1. Send POST request to /api/v1/login with empty body {"username": "", "password": ""}.  
2. Observe that the response returns 200 OK instead of 400 Bad Request.  

Expected Result: Validation error for empty fields.  
Actual Result: 200 OK with no error message.  

Attachments: [Postman_Screenshot_TC03.png]  
Priority: High  
Additional Notes for a Day With API Testing
Time Management: Testing APIs can take up most of the day depending on the number of endpoints and complexity.
Collaboration: Frequent discussions with developers to understand how the API works.
Repetitive Tasks: If endpoints are stable, test automation tools like Postman Collections can execute tests faster.
Would you like me to expand on automating API testing with Postman or dive deeper into how to write good API test cases?

 Can I have all this for the ui  design of the grid button, slider in grid size, canvas size for the uploaded image, the colour option of what the grid bc colour will be it should be clicked one to open the colour wheel and when I click out of it then the colour wheel closes and the grid changes colour. The colour pallet only appears as a dropdown list when palette button clicked and then user gets to select a colour the colour name hex code and pigment code go to bold format and the colour swatch beside the colour moves slightly and the box border becomes larger. When user then deselects the paint it goes back to normal this should happen when individually selected or the button select all is clicked and the deselects should happen when the paint is inidividly selected or deselected.

Here’s an extended version of the manual testing plan that includes edge cases and performance testing for the Tech Palette Mentor app, focusing on the UI design features for the grid button, slider, canvas size, color options, and palette interactions.

Extended Test Plan for UI Design Features
Overview
This extended test plan now includes edge case testing and performance scenarios in addition to the initial functional UI testing.

Features to Test
In addition to the previously described functionality, the following tests will cover edge cases and performance scenarios:

Feature	Description
Grid Button & Slider	Edge case tests for grid visibility, incorrect slider values (out of range), and boundary testing for slider movement.
Canvas Rendering	Performance tests for uploading large images, edge cases for unsupported file types, and handling of oversized images.
Grid Background Color	Test for boundary colors, invalid inputs (like clicking outside the color wheel), and performance under different color load scenarios.
Palette Dropdown	Edge case testing for palette behavior with minimal/maximal selections, rapid selection/deselection of multiple paints.
Paint Selection/Deselection	Performance when multiple paint options are selected/deselected quickly.

Edge Case Testing
Test Case ID	Feature	Test Data	Expected Result
TC10	Grid Button	Click grid button multiple times rapidly	Grid toggles visibility with no UI crash or delay.
TC11	Grid Slider	Move slider to 0 or 12	The grid does not appear when slider is at 0; grid shows 12 columns/rows when slider is at 12.
TC12	Canvas Rendering	Upload a 10MB high-resolution image	The image uploads successfully, but the app compresses or scales it appropriately to fit within the canvas.
TC13	Grid Color Change	Click outside of the color wheel	No grid color change should occur if the user clicks outside the color wheel (invalid interaction).
TC14	Palette Dropdown	Click rapidly between multiple colors	Dropdown remains stable, and no selection or deselection anomalies occur.
TC15	Paint Selection/Deselection	Select and deselect all paints in rapid succession	All selections/deselections should work seamlessly without UI delay or glitch.

Performance Testing
Test Case ID	Feature	Test Data	Expected Result
TC16	Canvas Rendering	Upload 5-10 high-res images (over 10MB each)	The app handles multiple large image uploads without crashing, with images compressed and resized as needed.
TC17	Grid Button & Slider	Rapidly toggle grid and move the slider back and forth	The grid and slider should adjust smoothly without lag or crash.
TC18	Palette Dropdown	Open and close the dropdown 50 times quickly	The dropdown opens and closes without delay or lag, and all selected colors are correctly registered.
TC19	Paint Selection/Deselection	Select/deselect 50+ colors in quick succession	The UI should not experience any lag, and all selections/deselections should be reflected immediately.
