## 3. Features to Test  
| **Feature**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |  
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| OAuth Login              | Verify login via Google OAuth integration.                                                                                                                             |  
| Image Upload             | Ensure only JPG, PNG, or IMG files are accepted. Validate image compression to under 1MB.                                                                              |  
| Hex Value Extraction     | Clicking on an uploaded image returns the correct hex color value for the selected pixel.                                                                              |  
| Color Blending           | Verify the paint blending functionality works with constraints (1-10 paints).                                                                                         |  
| Grid Overlay             | Check the grid slider adjusts grid size dynamically between 2-12.

## 4. Risks  
- Delayed API responses during OAuth testing.  
- High-resolution images may fail compression or slow the app.  

---

## 5. Test Deliverables  
- Updated test cases (Excel).  
- Bug reports (JIRA).  
- Test execution logs and screenshots.  

---

## 6. Test Schedule  
| **Task**                | **Owner**      | **Date**       |  
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|  
| Write Test Cases        | QA Engineer    | [4th Sept 2024]  |  
| Execute Test Cases      | QA Engineer    |  [7th Sept 2024] |  
| Log Bugs in JIRA        | QA Engineer    |  7th [Sept 2024]  |
