8:30 AM - Morning Standup and Review of Tickets

Review JIRA Issues:
The QA tester starts their day by reviewing open tickets and bug reports in Jira. They check any new issues related to the Tech Palette Mentor app and confirm which features need testing based on the latest builds from the dev team. This might include issues like:

Grid visibility toggling
Color selection functionality
Palette dropdown and paint color selection
Daily Meeting:
The tester attends the daily standup with the development team to clarify which features are ready for testing and discuss any blockers. They align on the testing scope for the day.

9:00 AM - Writing Test Scenarios Using Gherkin

Create or Update Gherkin Scenarios:
The tester writes Gherkin scenarios for newly implemented features or updates in the Tech Palette Mentor app. These scenarios reflect the functionality of the app and are aligned with the development team's latest changes.

Example Scenarios (written in Gherkin):

gherkin

Feature: Tech Palette Mentor Grid Functionality

Scenario: User clicks grid button to toggle visibility
  Given the user is logged into the app
  When the user clicks on the grid button
  Then the grid should toggle visibility

Scenario: User changes grid size using the slider
  Given the user has clicked on the grid button
  When the user moves the grid size slider to 10
  Then the grid should display 10 rows and columns

Documenting:
The tester documents any relevant information about the tests, like test scenarios, expected outcomes, and specific test data.

10:30 AM - Automated Test Development Using Gherkin and Selenium (Tomato doing this)

Generating Automated Test Steps:
With the Gherkin scenarios created, the tester now uses the Tomato CLI to automatically generate the test steps. This involves feeding the Gherkin scenarios into the system, which then outputs JavaScript test steps for Selenium to execute. For example:

javascript
// Test Step: Grid Visibility Toggle
const gridButton = document.querySelector('.grid-button');
gridButton.click();
expect(document.querySelector('.grid')).toBeVisible();
Writing Selenium Tests:
The tester writes the necessary Selenium WebDriver tests based on the Gherkin scenarios. These tests ensure that the Tech Palette Mentor app works as expected. They use Node.js with Selenium WebDriver for automation.
